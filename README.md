# SmartQueue

## Problem Statement

Manual queue management in public service sectors—such as hospitals, banks, government offices, and educational institutions—often results in inefficiencies, long wait times, and poor user experiences. Traditional first-come, first-served systems fail to account for urgency or special cases, placing vulnerable individuals like senior citizens and emergency patients at a disadvantage.

## About SmartQueue

**SmartQueue** is an intelligent queue management system developed in **C++** using strong **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. It addresses the shortcomings of traditional queues by:

- **Prioritizing users** based on predefined categories (e.g., students, senior citizens, emergency cases)
- **Dynamically adjusting** service order according to urgency and fairness
- **Registering and managing** users efficiently
- **Maintaining history logs** for transparency and analysis

Through the use of **inheritance** and **polymorphism**, SmartQueue offers a modular, scalable solution that adapts easily to real-world environments.
